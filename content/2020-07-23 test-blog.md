If you are seeing this post then you must have found my blog very early on, or you have scrolled right to the end, either way Hello There!

This post is here for me to test writing a blog in this format and to make sure everything works. Special shout out to Dan, my first official reader.

As a special treat, here is a picture of my parents new puppy, Stan.

The blog is all written in Markdown, so I can embed images and format my text easily.

```java
  System.out.println("I can also add code snippets!")
```

Plus it is automatically converted to html, so I can also add things which wouldn't usually be possible in pure Markdown, like `iframe` tags, which allow me to do things like embed youtube videos:

<div id="videoDiv">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdvxNF2jCa4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
