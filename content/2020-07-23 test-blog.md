If you are seeing this post then you must have found my blog very early on, or you have scrolled right to the end, either way Hello There!

This post is here for me to test writing a blog in this format and to make sure everything works. Special shout out to Dan, my first official reader.

As a special treat, here is a picture of my parents new puppy, Stan.

The blog is all written in Markdown, so I can do embed images and format my text easily.

```java
  System.out.println("I can also add code snippets!")
