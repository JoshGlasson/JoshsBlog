<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>
	I started a <a href="https://joshlearningto.code.blog" target="_blank">blog on Wordpress</a> where I have been focussing on writing about my development as a software engineer.
</p>

<p>
	Seeing as I am learning to code, I wanted to try and create my own blog. Doing this also gives me the flexibility to write about whatever I want, expanding out to my hobbies such as gaming and sports.
