And with the utter dominance he is showing in his Mercedes, that number will only continue to rise.</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/lewham-most-podiums.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton Breaks Another Record\">\n        <figcaption>Lewis Hamilton Breaks Another Record</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1\" target=\"_blank\">Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>The two Mercedes once again qualified on the front row, after only 0.059 seconds separated them.</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/bottas-qualy.png\" alt=\"Bottas Unable to Match Hamitlon in Qualifying\">\n        <figcaption>Bottas Unable to Match Hamitlon in Qualifying</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8t4lbw6pBE\" target=\"_blank\">Formula 1 Spanish GP Qualifying Highlights</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>The start of the race was good for Hamilton, who got out in front, then lead every lap until the end to take his 4th Spanish GP victory in a row. </p>\n<p>It was not so good for Bottas, who dropped down to from 2nd to 4th after Verstappen and Lance Stroll in the Racing Point were able to slipstream the front runners and go past him. He fought back into 3rd, but throughout the race was never really able to catch up to Verstappen. By the end of the race, Bottas was too far behind to challenge for second, instead pitting for fresh tyres with a few laps to go in order to ensure he would get the extra point for fastest lap. Not only did he achieve the fastest lap, he set the track record for a race lap at <strong>1:18.183</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/spanish-gp-bottas-bad-start.png\" alt=\"Poor Start for Bottas\">\n        <figcaption>Poor Start for Bottas</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yHbZWfkBwU\" target=\"_blank\">Formula 1 Spanish GP Race Highlights</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>Charles Leclerc was having a decent race in the Ferrari after a dissapointing qualifying result which saw him start in 9th, but ended up frustrated as his engine cut out after hitting a bump on a corner. He was able to restart the engine and get to the pit, however he ultimately had to retire from the race. </p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <p class=\"tweetToEmbed\" style=\"display: none;\">1295035591327809536</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Sebastian Vettel in the other Ferrari had a decent race, despite clear frustration with his team. He qualified in 11th after failing to reach Q3, but managed to convert a one stop stategy into 7th place after great tyre management. Segio Perez in the Racing Point was the only other driver to run with the one stop strategy and manage to score points. This performance got him the driver of the day award from the fans.</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/spanish-gp-vettle-dotd.jpg\" alt=\"Spanish GP Driver of the Day\">\n        <figcaption>Spanish GP Driver of the Day</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1\" target=\"_blank\">Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>Alex Albon in the second Red Bull cannot be too happy with his team either. He qualified in 6th place and had a really great start to the race, but was put onto a rather different strategy that seemed to really halt his progress, ultimately leading him to finish in 8th. The team pitted him early and put him onto hard tyres, he came back out into traffic and never managed to get up to speed. He eventually pitted again for mediums but the damage had already been done.</p>\n<p>The Racing Point&#39;s were able to maintain their qualifying positions and finish in 4th and 5th, with Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll swapping positions, the Canadian Stroll finishing ahead of his team mate after Perez got a 5 second penalty for ignoring blue flags.</p>\n<p>Carlos Sainz in his McLaren was able to finish his home Grand Prix in 6th place, gaining a position from qualifying. Lando Norris in the other McLaren had a slightly more disappointing result, finishing 10th after qualifying 8th, however he did put in a good defensive performance, holding off a charge from Leclerc earlier in the race.</p>\n<p>Romain Grosjean on the penultimate lap had a close shave after hitting a curb and almost spinning, hitting a sweet drift in the process.</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/spanish-gp-grosjean-drifting.gif\" alt=\"Grosjean Drifting Gif\">\n    </figure>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/spanish-gp-grosjean-drift.png\" alt=\"Grosjean Drift\">\n        <figcaption>Grosjean Drift</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yHbZWfkBwU\" target=\"_blank\">Formula 1 Spanish GP Race Highlights</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>Ultimately it was another race where the Mercedes showed just how good they really are, lapping every other car bar the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. </p>\n<p>Here are the results from this week:</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/spanish-gp-results.jpg\" alt=\"Spanish GP Results\">\n        <figcaption>Spanish GP Results</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1\" target=\"_blank\">Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>And here are the driver standings now, with Hamilton 37 points clear at the top:</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/spanish-gp-overall-standings.jpg\" alt=\"Current F1 Driver Standings Top 10\">\n        <figcaption>Current F1 Driver Standings Top 10</figcaption>\n        <figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1\" target=\"_blank\">Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>Two weeks off now as we eagerly await the Belgian Grand Prix.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"bonus-content\">BONUS CONTENT:</h3>\n<p>I couldn&#39;t write about the Spanish GP and not mention the latest video bombing from the Williams Racing crew:</p>\n<div id=\"imageDiv\">\n    <p class=\"tweetToEmbed\" style=\"display: none;\">1294967613341212674</p>\n</div>\n","slug":"f1_2020_spanish_gp","title":"F1 Recap - Spanish Grand Prix 2020.","headline":"Another dominant performance from Lewis Hamilton","image":"./images/icons_same_size/f1 logo 2020.png","sortdate":"2020-08-16","originaldate":"2020-08-16","tags":["Formula 1"]}
