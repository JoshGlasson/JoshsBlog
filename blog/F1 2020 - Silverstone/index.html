By the time he was able to pit for new tyres he had already dropped out of the points positions. Max Verstappen, who was in third place in the Red Bull, flew passed him into second, behind Hamilton by about 15 seconds. The gap between second place Verstappen and third place Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari was over 30 seconds, so Red Bull called him into the pit to put fresh tyres on. He would still come out of the pit in second place, and could try and go for the fastest lap to earn an extra point, plus his tyres were no doubt struggling too. With no realistic chance of catching up to the Mercedes in first, this seemed like a sensible decision.</p> <div id=imageDiv> <figure> <img alt="Valterri Bottas' Tyre Puncture" src="./images/2020-08-03 F1 2020 - Silverstone/bottas tyre.png"> <figcaption>Valterri Bottas' Tyre Puncture</figcaption> <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmEsqWosuS8" target=_blank>Formula 1 YouTube Race Highlights</a></figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Shortly after, Carlos Sainz suffered a puncture to the front left tyre of the McLaren, after having a decent race where he had gone from 7th in qualifying up to 4th place.

We do know the Silverstone is a tough track on the tyres, especially the front left due to all of the right turns. There may also have been debris on the track from the two crashes, and another incident where Kimi Räikkönen's front wing came off (which also punctured his front left tyre). The tyres had also been on for almost 40 laps at the time of failure, which is a long time, although within the number of laps they are rated for. The likely answer is a combination of all of these was the cause of the punctures. </p> <p>Outside of this drama, Leclerc managed 3rd place after holding on to 4th for most of the race (until Bottas' crash). After that there was an interesting battle between Daniel Ricciardo in the Renault and the McLarens of Sainz and Lando Norris. Romain Grosjean did his best in the Haas to get involved in this battle, however he got into trouble as he didn't stop after the Safety Car and was handed a black-and-white flag for his defensive manoeuvres, and ended the race in 16th. Sebastian Vettel in the other Ferrari was nowhere to be seen in the battles, despite his teammate doing so well. Also Lance Stroll in the Racing Point did not have his best day, finishing 9th after qualifying in 6th.</p> <p>The other Racing Point did not even start the race, which gave a sad ending to an otherwise fairytale story for Nico Hulkenberg, who had flown in on Thursday night to replace Sergio Perez. Perez is likely to miss the next race still, so Hulkenberg has a chance to make an impression next week.</p> <p>Here are all the points scorers from Silverstone this week:</p> <div id=imageDiv> <figure> <img alt="Silverstone Top 10" src="./images/2020-08-03 F1 2020 - Silverstone/silverstone results.jpg"> <figcaption>Silverstone Top 10</figcaption> <figcaption>Source: <a href=https://twitter.com/F1 target=_blank>Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>As Bottas dropped to 11th after his tyre troubles and scored no points, Hamilton is now leading the championship by 30 points.</p> <div id=imageDiv> <figure> <img alt="Current F1 Driver Standings" src="./images/2020-08-03 F1 2020 - Silverstone/driver standings.png"> <figcaption>Current F1 Driver Standings</figcaption> <figcaption>Source: <a href=https://twitter.com/F1 target=_blank>Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The action continues at Silverstone next week, with the 70th Anniversary GP.</p> </div> <div id=myModal class="svelte-40vjgw modal"> <span class="svelte-40vjgw close">×</span> <img alt="modal generated" class="svelte-40vjgw modal-content" id=img01> <div id=caption class=svelte-40vjgw></div></div> <div class=svelte-b7hd5f><a href=about><img alt=Me src="./images/about/Small Profile Pic.jpg" class="svelte-b7hd5f signature-image"></a> <h3 class=svelte-b7hd5f>Post by</h3> <a href=about><h1 class=svelte-b7hd5f>Josh Glasson</h1></a> <h3 class=svelte-b7hd5f>Software Developer.
