After that there was an interesting battle between Daniel Ricciardo in the Renault and the McLarens of Sainz and Lando Norris. Romain Grosjean did his best in the Haas to get involved in this battle, however he got into trouble as he didn't stop after the Safety Car and was handed a black-and-white flag for his defensive manoeuvres, and ended the race in 16th. Sebastian Vettel in the other Ferrari was nowhere to be seen in the battles, despite his teammate doing so well. Also Lance Stroll in the Racing Point did not have his best day, finishing 9th after qualifying in 6th.</p> <p>The other Racing Point did not even start the race, which gave a sad ending to an otherwise fairytale story for Nico Hulkenberg, who had flown in on Thursday night to replace Sergio Perez. Perez is likely to miss the next race still, so Hulkenberg has a chance to make an impression next week.</p> <p>Here are all the points scorers from Silverstone this week:</p> <div id=imageDiv> <figure> <img alt="Silverstone Top 10" src=https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/silverstone-results.jpg> <figcaption>Silverstone Top 10</figcaption> <figcaption>Source: <a href=https://twitter.com/F1 target=_blank>Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>As Bottas dropped to 11th after his tyre troubles and scored no points, Hamilton is now leading the championship by 30 points.</p> <div id=imageDiv> <figure> <img alt="Current F1 Driver Standings" src=https://joshlearningtocode.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/driver-standings.png> <figcaption>Current F1 Driver Standings</figcaption> <figcaption>Source: <a href=https://twitter.com/F1 target=_blank>Official F1 Twitter</a></figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The action continues at Silverstone next week, with the 70th Anniversary GP.</p> </div> <br> <div class=svelte-b7hd5f><a href=about><img alt=Me src="./images/about/Small Profile Pic.jpg" class="svelte-b7hd5f signature-image"></a> <h3 class=svelte-b7hd5f>Post by</h3> <a href=about><h1 class=svelte-b7hd5f>Josh Glasson</h1></a> <h3 class=svelte-b7hd5f>Software Developer.
