ZSH is what has replaced bash on newer macOSs. Oh My ZSH lets you use loads of plugins and themes to make the command line even better. Personally I have the git plugin which tells you which branch you are in and if you have made any changes. I also use features like auto suggestions on commands and their custom profile to create shortcuts.
