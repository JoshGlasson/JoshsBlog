## Things to Remember

- In the blog posts, original date is the date the blog was posted. This is the date displayed at the top of the page. Sort Date is the date used to sort the posts on the Recent Posts page. If a post is updated substantially, the sort date should be updated in order to move the post back up the list, however the original date should remain the same. It should be clear in the post what was updated and when.
